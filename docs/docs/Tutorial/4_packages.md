# 4. Packages in DishPy

DishPy 0.5.0 ships with a beta (extremely experimental) version of package management through a registry-based system (somewhat similar to PROS' approach, but much simpler and more limited in scope).

Because of its experimental nature, I won't be writing any tutorials until I finish all of its features and stabilize the API. Thanks for understanding!
